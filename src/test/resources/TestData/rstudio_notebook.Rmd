# Some examples of using the Daisy wrapper for remote execution


Read libraries

```{r}
require(ggplot2)
```

Download daisy.jar so we can run simulations remotely, if we don't have it already

```{r}
if (!file.exists("daisy.jar")) 
  download.file("https://daisy.nitrogensensor.eu/resultat/diverse/daisy.jar", "daisy.jar")
```


Run a single daisy simulation.

This chunk runs daisy on Exercise01.dai. 
Make sure that you have that file in the same directory as this script. 

```{r} 
args <-  c("-jar daisy.jar client -d . Exercise01.dai")
system2("java", args = args)
```

# Load daisy results into dataframes

TBD
